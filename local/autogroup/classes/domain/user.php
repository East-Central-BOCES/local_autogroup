 * autogroup local plugin
 *
 * A user object relates to a real Moodle user; it acts as a container
 * for multiple courses which in turn contain multiple groups.
 * Initialising a course object will automatically load each autogroup
 * group which could be relevant for a user into memory.
 *
 * A user is also a group member; a membership register is also maintained
 * by this class.
